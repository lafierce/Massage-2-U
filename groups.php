Employees who perceive their jobs as stressful spend 50% more on healthcare (3).  Also, employees that take sick leave due to stress related illness and injuries are absent for a longer period of time (4).  Studies have shown that massage at the workplace can reduce stress.  Blood pressure, a leading indicator or stress, is reduced after a 15min massage (5).  Book now and reduce turnover costs and increase employee satisfaction and productivity.</li>
