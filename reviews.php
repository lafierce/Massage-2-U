says:</span> Danielle gave a great massage. The pressure was deep
enough to get to the real soreness in my shoulders and back, She showed
up on time and made sure to ask what areas I was having problems with.
I would definitely recommend her. <span class="grey italic">(10/10/2010)</span>

<p><span class="bold underline">TJ M. says:</span>
The in-home massage was very convenient. Danielle made sure to ask what
I areas I needed work on and was able to set up quickly while I
finished the intake form. She did a great job of mixing different
pressures for the areas that had more tension or needed more work. Plus
the massage actually lasted the full time scheduled instead of the way
some places subtract time for dressing etc... I would recommend this
for anyone with a busy schedule.
One of the best massages...... <span class="grey italic">(7/7/2010)</p>

authentic massage....people who take their work as passion are not only
successful but also transform into humble personalities, and i must
say, she ( Danielle ) is one of them____ Sam <span class="grey italic">(july 07,2010)</span></p>
