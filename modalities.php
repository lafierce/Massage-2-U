<p><span class="large_underline bold">Tandem Massage:</span>  Tandem massage is when 2 therapists work on 1 client at the same time.  This is a truly unique experience.

Your entire body is massage twice in the same amount of time as 1 regular massage.  Also known as:  4 handed massage, four hands massage.</p>

<p><span class="large_underline bold">Deep Tissue Massage:</span>  Firm pressure is used during the massage to go deeper into the the muscles to relieve tightness and knots. This type of massage is more therapeutic than swedish massage.  However, most deep tissue massages incorporate swedish techniques.  Deep tissue is often combined with sports massage.</p>

<p><span class="large_underline bold">Sports Massage:</span>  Sports massage is commonly used by athletes to prepare for an event or to recover from an injury.

<p><span class="large_underline bold">Swedish Massage:</span>  This is the most common type of massage and swedish techniques are used in most types of massage.  The four basic strokes are effleurage, petrissage, friction and tapotement. Effleurage is the long flowing strokes, petrissage is the kneading strokes, friction is used to generate heat and bring blood to the surface, and tapotement is the hitting type strokes.
