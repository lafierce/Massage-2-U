<p id="rust_header">About Us</p>

<p><span class="m2uEm smallText">Massage 2 U</span> is an outcall massage provider servicing the Houston area.  
This business was adapted from Thomas Zeppelinâ€™s (co-owner) original 
website <a href="http://www.zeppelinmassage.com">www.zeppelinmassage.com</a>.   
Its ease of use and automated online scheduling features were the cornerstone 
in developing a business that provides the same type of features - not only its 
clients but - for the therapists as well.  We have extended this convenience by 
accepting secure credit card and Paypal payments.</p>

<p><span class="rustHeader normalText">Thomas Zeppelin (co-owner)</span><br />
I am an American of German descent; born and raised north of Pittsburgh, PA. 
Go Steelers! I moved to Houston in 1987 while following my career as a service 
engineer for CT and MRI scanners. After many years, I decided to seek a more rewarding career helping others feel well in body, 
mind and spirit. Upon graduating from Health Masters School of Massage and Sports 
Massage 1 & 2; I found my calling as a massage therapist.  I have been practicing for many years.  
I will use my personal experience and wisdom in running a successful massage business to help <span class="m2uEm smallText">Massage 2 U</span> succeed.</p>

I am originally from Baton Rouge, LA.  I graduated from LSU A&M in 2004 with a BS in zoology minor in psychology.  
I moved to Houston in 2007 to work in the chemical industry.  I now work as an engineer 
servicing lab equipment for the gulf coast area.  My experience as the sole service provider 
for such a large area has given me insight into running a business of my own.  The skills I have taken in sales and
services leads as well as maintaining customer relationships will be utilized in the management of this company.</p>
